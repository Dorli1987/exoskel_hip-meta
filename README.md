# Powered Hip Orthosis Meta Project

Resources and design elements for building a powered hip orthosis. Project work for medical device engineering course at MCI/Mechatronics.

## Motivation

This project is part of a course assignment at the **MCI Management Center Innsbruck** department for *Mechatronics/Medical Engineering* to build a powered exoskeleton to support a patient with spastic legs while walking. The repository contains a collection of resources on the subject, as well as designs and schematics concerning a powered hip joint.

## Resources

### Technical

#### Microcontrollers

Candidates for use in the Project:

- Arduino Uno, for first prototyping: https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3

- ESP32, WiFi and Bluetooth enabled controller: https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview
